    "Chi-Square test helps one to determine **if there is a significant relationship between two categotical variables** and the corresponding target variable. It does not follow the normal distribution because it is not a parametric statistical test. Imagine we have list of frequencies of gender (Male and Female) and we are trying to find the relationship between gender against features like highest level of education.\n",

    "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that simultaneously compares `means` across several groups to determine if observed differences are due to chance or reflect genuine distinctions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- the observations are independent within and across groups,\n",
    "- the data within each group are nearly normal, and\n",
    "- the variability across the groups is about equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these three conditions are met, one may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the `means` are equal."

    "It evaluates whether a sample significantly differs from a population mean, either exceeding or falling short. When the sample mean falls within critical regions on either distribution tail, it signifies a departure from the population mean, prompting the rejection of the null hypothesis for the alternative.\n",

    "- A typical example of application of two-tailed test can be seen in production, like during candy packaging at a facility. If the target is 50 candies per bag, bags with fewer than 45 or more than 55 candies are rejected."
